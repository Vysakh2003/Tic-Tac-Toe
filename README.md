# Tic-Tac-Toe

✔️ The given code is a Python implementation of a simple 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br><br>
✔️ It allows two players to take turns entering their moves on a 3x3 board.<br><br>
✔️ The game checks for winning patterns (diagonals, rows, and columns) after each move to determine if a player has won.<br><br>
✔️ If no player wins after all the cells are filled, the game ends in a tie.<br><br>
✔️ The program displays the board at each step, informs the players of the game's outcome (win, tie, or ongoing), and records the number of rounds played to win.<br><br>
✔️ The code offers an interactive command-line interface for players to enjoy the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br><br>
